    <div class="block">
      <p>mobile Helping Babies Survive (mHBS) is a digital health tool developed by collaborators at Indiana University
        School of Medicine and Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing. The mHBS suite consists of 3
        separate apps, serving functions related to data collection and reporting, access to educational resources, and
        data visualization. For health care providers, the primary functions of mHBS are to increase their access to
        educational resources, and to improve their ability to collect data about key variables, outcomes, and program
        metrics, which, in turn, will enhance the ability of health care providers to deliver, monitor, and evaluate,
        evidence-based maternal/newborn health interventions. The mHBS apps are powered by the District Health
        Information Software (DHIS 2) in the back-end for data storage and tracking of health workers.</p>
      <p>The mHBS Training App is a health care provider training app focused on training for newborn care, through
        videos, digitized provider guides, and other kinds of training material.</p>
